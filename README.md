# HSAF-DWAN

Hybrid Self-Aligned Fusion with Dual-Weight Attention Network for Alzheimer’s Detection

## Overview

Dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD), affects millions of elderly individuals worldwide. This project introduces **HSAF-DWAN** – a novel multimodal architecture aimed at improving the automatic detection of Alzheimer’s disease by leveraging audio recordings, transcripts, and attention-weighted images.

The core innovation of HSAF-DWAN lies in its ability to integrate diverse data modalities through specialized modules, enhancing the model's capability to detect AD-related patterns with increased accuracy and reliability.
